    <p>It is always good practice to carry a physical book around especially if you spend all day looking at your computer. This quarter, I always have my hand-dandy Learning JavaScript book as it has become an essential part of my belongings. I carry it with me constantly as a way to condition myself to look at it whenever I have a little bit of down time. </p>

    <p>I have a love, hate relationship with this book but over this past quarter, my JavaScript book has become an essential part of my belongings. I carry it with me constantly as a way to condition myself to look at it whenever I have a little bit of down time. I enjoy having physical books as I find that I learn more efficiently when I am able to make notes within the pages.</p>
