    <p>It is always good practice to carry a physical book around especially if you spend all day looking at your computer. This quarter, I always have my hand-dandy Learning JavaScript book as it has become an essential part of my belongings. I carry it with me constantly as a way to condition myself to look at it whenever I have a little bit of down time. </p>

    <p>Hydration is very important especially if you spend all day being a busy bee. I always carry one of my three hydroflasks mainly to reduce my carbon footprint from wasting plastic bottles. I love how these badboys keep my water hot or cold throughout the day. Though it adds quite a bit of weight to my bag, I find that it's a must for whatever I do.</p>

    <p>Bright, colorful, and helpful. I only started carrying around hilighters this quarter as a way to improve my study habits. If you look inside my Learning JavaScript book you will find pages full of blue and pink stripes. Not only does it help me remeber important information, it also adds a pop of color to every page.</p>
