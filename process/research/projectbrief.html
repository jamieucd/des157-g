    <h3>Topic Summary</h3>
    <p>Imagining America is an national organization that was created as an initiative to promote the engagement between artists and scholars in addressing critical social matters through collaboration and creative thinking. As a platform meant to
      engage and inform members of their efforts, Imagining America asked us to redesign their website as a place that fully embodies their values and provide a place to educate and network creatively. Through layers of developmental research, we
      aim to help build a solid foundation that fits their needs.</p>

    <h3>Target Audience Description</h3>
    <p>Imagining America strives to reach current and prospective university members and others in the production of public knowledge. People that are passionate about solving issues that our community has. The site will cater to a wide range of
      people with varying degrees of knowledge about Imagining America.</p>

    <h3>Goals of the Project</h3>
    <p>Our team aims to design and produce an updated version of Imagining Americaâ€™s website that will help establish their graphic identity and further increase audience engagement. In order to so, we will be creating a solid foundation that they
      will be able build from in the future. This requires us to standardize our designs for them to easily modify material and maintain cohesion. For their website, we intend to create a user-friendly interface that is well structured to manage
      organization for easy updates.</p>

    <h3>Visual Strategies</h3>
    <p>We hope to create a site that is clean and easy navigate by using a thoughtful combination of bold colors and interesting graphic elements. By introducing new colors and typefaces, we will significantly modernize the Imagining America website
      with intention to appeal to a younger demographic. We will improve the layout of the site by displaying large bodies of text in an inviting manner that encourages audience members to learn more without feeling overwhelmed. By implementing a
      hierarchy of imagery and text, we hope to cultivate an experience that is inviting for everyone.
