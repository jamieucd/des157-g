  <h1>Imagining America</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>What is Imagining America?</h3>
    <p>Imagining America is an organization that was founded by the White House Millennium Council, University of Michigan, and Woodrow Fellowship Foundation during a 1999 White House Conference in a time where the arts, design, and humanities were
      pushing to be recognized as a beneficial part of society. In response, Imagining America was developed to be a national initiative encouraging community engagement to addressing current critical social issues through multidisciplinary thinking
      and creative solutions.</p>

    <h3>What does Imagining America do?</h3>
    <p>This organization focuses on promoting higher educational experiences through the development of programs, events, and resources designed to unify the efforts of artists, researchers, students, faculty, and public services in restoring a
      democratic culture. Tackling matters of social injustice, to social depravity, Imagining America seeks to be a foundation for creative liberation and imagination.</p>


    <p>Over Imagining America's lifetime, it has also become a source for education, socialization, and expression as their goal is to establish networks amongst dilettantes and professionals to help with leadership development. Currently based in
      Davis, California near the UC Davis campus, IA has found its way to multiple Universities as they host gathering events all over the nation in addition to providing workshops, seminars, and performances.
    </p>

    <p>In addition, Imagining America provides an abundant amount of opportunities for student engagements and Initiatives. The Page Fellows, for example, is a peer networking group for graduate students to the discuss concerns that they may face at the end of
      their education when heading into the competitive job market. It is designed to inform graduates who are looking for a future in pursing jobs in humanities and arts.</p>
    <p>Another Initiative that they started includes Engagement Scholars. Similar to Page Fellows, this initiative was for graduating students from Syracuse University. From 2009 to 2016, this programs purpose was to help with the transition into
      the professional world of Central Ney York.
