    <p>My storyboard is of two scenerios where people may find and use the Imagining America website. The first is of a recent student who does not yet know how to pursue a career after graduation but wants to use their art degree to make a difference in their communitity. Imagining America provides a variety of possible ways to help start that transition from school to being a professional. In the next scene, this character conducts a Google search and happens to stumble upon the Imgaining America website page for their Engaged Scholar Study. After searching through the various initiatives that are offerded, this character wants to learn more and decides to attend their National Gathering conference as a way to network with other scholars.
    </p>
    <p>The other story is of a college student who is part of the Young Democrats Club on campus. She is very invloved in trying to get fellow peers to join the club and/or participate in the upcoming elections. She is passionate about showing how important exercising the right to vote is but is having trouble successfully communicating it. Through consulting a few other memebers, she hears of Imagining America because one of her professors is a member and finds that they have an report about a report that they did focused on increasing college student participation in improving political learning. Inspired, she becomes an IA member to access more resources.</p>
